### **About**

This website was created with the OTTR_Template_Website template.


We have 3 workshops each covering one of the following topics:

1. What is gene expression data?
2. What are cloud computing resources and how can you use them, specifically Galaxy?
3. How is AI useful for scientific research and how do you use it responsibly?
